# About repository

The purpose of this repository is to transform the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) data to a required format for data insight generation. The repository includes AIHW data and Jupyter Notebook as well as the transformed data file.

The data "State and territory community mental health care 2018-19" is originally from the "Mental health services in Australia" collection by the AIHW. This data cube includes service contacts, patient characteristics, legal status, session type, and duration and state and territory breakdowns. The data is available at (https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/data?page=1)

The Jupyter Notebook is a written Python program language that reads the AIHW data to transform into a required format for data insight generation.
