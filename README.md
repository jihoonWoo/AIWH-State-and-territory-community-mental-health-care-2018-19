# Readme

The purpose of this repository is to store transformed data that will be used for insight generation. We saved the details of the process in 'data_transformation.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.

## Data 
Mental health services in Australia (MHSA) provides a picture of the national response of the health and welfare service system to the mental health care needs of Australians. The data "State and territory community mental health care 2018-19" is one of the data tables within the MHSA report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). This data includes information about mental health service contacts, patient characteristics, legal status, session type, and duration, and state and territory breakdowns. 

We transformed this AIHW data to an easy-to-process format and saved it to a new CSV file called “transformed_data.csv” in this repository.
